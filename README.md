## Setup & Installation

Setting up and running PrankServer involves two main steps: installing the necessary dependencies and launching the server.

### Dependencies Installation

Before running PrankServer, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Maven : You can download it from the [official website](https://maven.apache.org/).
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher : You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Launching the Server

Once you have the dependencies ready, follow these steps to launch PrankServer:

1. Open a terminal on the root of the project.
2. Run the following command to build the project:
   ```shell
   mvn clean package
   ```
3. Navigate to the `target` folder generated by the previous step.
4. Initiate the server by running the following command, replace `<jar_name>` with the actual name of the generated JAR 
5. file: (you have to run the jar with all the dependency)
   ```shell
   java -jar <jar_name>
   ```

### Persistent Server Setup

If you desire to maintain PrankServer up and running even if your friends terminate the process, additional steps are required:

1. Place the file contained in `run_it` in the same location where you copied the JAR file.
2. Rename the JAR file to `WebServer.jar`.
3. Run the batch file.

Please note, after completing these steps the only way to terminate the server is through the `shutdown` endpoint.

Enjoy your pranks responsibly!
